# Spotify Social

## Getting started

Add your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret to env vars. If you're developing locally, you can use a `.env` file.

Sample `.env` file:
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456
```

Then, just run `yarn install` and `yarn start`
